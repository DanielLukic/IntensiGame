Core module of the IntensiCode J2ME and J2SE game engine. The build system is not included.

h1. Description

IntensiGame is a simple J2ME and J2SE game framework with a 'game engine' at its core. This engine knows how to render 'frames' and keep track of time and issue the proper number of 'control ticks'.

The application has to "only" separate the drawing of the state and advancing the state. Everything else is handled by the framework.

h1. Usage

Please see the example screens to understand the separation of frames and ticks.

See an example application/game to understand how to initialize the system. (Extend the IntensiGame class and your done.. :)
